# YJBCannon
## About
YJBCannon is an open-source Spigot plugin for Minecraft 1.8.x that provides all the necessary "cannoning" features one would need on their server. 
YJBCannon was originally a paid plugin that was made free and open-source for accessibility reasons. This decision was also made in consideration of the deprecated 1.8 Spigot API and declining demand for such a product. The plugin is not actively maintained by its creator, Andy Stanciu (alias yJb), however contributing will still remain open to the public and pull requests will be reviewed on a somewhat active basis.
## Dependencies
YJBCannon depends on the following spigot plugins for Minecraft 1.8: `PlaceholderAPI 2.10.9`, `ProtocolLib 4.5.0`, `WorldEdit 6.1.4`, and `PlotSquared 3.821` (provided).
External dependencies include `TacoSpigot 1.8.8`, `Java-WebSocket 1.5.1`, `slf4j 1.6.4`, `httpclient 4.5.10`, and `json 20180130`.
